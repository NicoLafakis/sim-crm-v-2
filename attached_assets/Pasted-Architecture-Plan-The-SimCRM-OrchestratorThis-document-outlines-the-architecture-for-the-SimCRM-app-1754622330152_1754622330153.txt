Architecture Plan: The SimCRM OrchestratorThis document outlines the architecture for the SimCRM application, reflecting the current implementation in the Replit development environment. The system orchestrates the creation and evolution of simulated CRM data based on user-defined parameters, leveraging a modern TypeScript stack.1. Core ComponentsThe system is composed of three main components:The React Frontend (Vite + TypeScript): The user interface built with React and TypeScript, served via Vite. It captures the user's simulation parameters (SaaS Tool, Theme, Industry, etc.) and uses TanStack Query to manage server state and communicate with the backend. The global game state is managed via a Zustand store (client/src/lib/game-state.ts).The Backend Orchestrator (Hono + Node.js): A lightweight, fast backend server built using the Hono framework on Node.js. It's responsible for handling API requests from the client, managing simulation logic, and interfacing with the database.PostgreSQL Database with Drizzle ORM: A PostgreSQL database serves as the persistent data store. The application interacts with the database through Drizzle ORM, which provides a type-safe way to query and manage data. The database schema is explicitly defined in shared/schema.ts.2. Data Flow & LogicHereâ€™s the step-by-step flow of how a simulation runs within the established architecture:Initiation: The user configures a simulation in the React app and clicks "Start Simulation." The frontend, using a mutation from TanStack Query, sends a single JSON payload to a dedicated API endpoint defined in the Hono router (server/routes.ts). This payload contains the entire simulation configuration.Orchestrator Receives Request: The Hono server receives the configuration object. It validates the data and uses a Drizzle ORM function to write a new entry to the simulations table in the PostgreSQL database. This table stores the high-level rules for this run.Job Scheduling (Conceptual): This remains the next logical step. Upon creating the simulation record, the orchestrator will begin to schedule jobs.The "Rules": The orchestrator will query the industry_crm_benchmarks.csv data to determine the cadence and type of activities to simulate.Implementation: A job queue system (like BullMQ or a simpler alternative like node-cron for scheduled tasks) will be integrated into the Hono server. It will create entries in a scheduled_jobs table.Job Execution: A separate worker process (or a scheduled function within the main server process) will execute the jobs.When a job runs, it will call the Persona Generation Agent to get persona-driven JSON data.The worker will then use the appropriate API client (e.g., the HubSpot Node.js client) to send this data to the target CRM.The result of the job (success, failure, created record ID) will be logged back to the scheduled_jobs table using Drizzle.3. PostgreSQL Database Schema (Drizzle)The schema is defined in shared/schema.ts using Drizzle's syntax. This provides end-to-end type safety between the database and the application code.simulations Table (as defined in schema.ts):id (SERIAL, PRIMARY KEY)userId (VARCHAR) - The "Player Name"saasTool (VARCHAR) - e.g., "HubSpot"theme (VARCHAR) - e.g., "Rock Band"industry (VARCHAR) - e.g., "SaaS"recordFrequency (VARCHAR) - e.g., "1h"status (VARCHAR) - e.g., "running", "paused", "completed"createdAt (TIMESTAMP)scheduled_jobs Table (to be added to schema.ts):id (SERIAL, PRIMARY KEY)simulationId (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to simulations.id)jobType (VARCHAR) - e.g., "CREATE_CONTACT", "UPDATE_DEAL"payload (JSONB) - Contains data for the job (e.g., persona details).scheduledFor (TIMESTAMP)status (VARCHAR) - e.g., "pending", "completed", "failed"result (JSONB, nullable) - Stores the outcome.4. Current Implementation NotesMonorepo Structure: The project uses a client, server, and shared directory structure, which is excellent for code sharing (especially the Drizzle schema).UI Components: The frontend leverages shadcn/ui for a solid, accessible component library, which is a great foundation.State Management: The combination of Zustand for global UI state and TanStack Query for server state is a powerful and modern approach.This updated plan accurately reflects the great work you've done in Replit and provides a clear path forward for implementing the job scheduling and execution logic.
